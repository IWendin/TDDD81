# Database Technology course 

This material is the lab serie of the course in database systems TDDD81.
I took the course during the spring of 2020

## Official introduction
Welcome to the Database Technology course!

This course has 4 lab assignments:

* Lab 1 introduces SQL
* Lab 2 introduces database design
* Lab 3 is about functional dependencies and normalization
* Lab 4 is a bigger project in which you will create a database for a hypothetical airline company

Please find the instructions for these assignments on the course Website.

We want you to manage your solutions to the lab assignments in a gitlab repository; that repository should be a *private* fork of the repository [olaha93/db](https://gitlab.ida.liu.se/olaha93/db). A fork is essentially a copy of the repository that goes under your own account.
